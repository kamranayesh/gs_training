1) you have created todo api. Now you have to shift all functions to a controler file called todocontroller.js . same as we did for products route. 
2)YOu did below assignemnt
 Create a users api
each user is an object with {name:"tom",email:"tom@asfas.com",creation_date:"12-dec-2001",username:"tom123"}

now create urls as 
 localhost:3001/users --> show all users in json
 localhost:3001/users/:id --> to show each users
 localhost:3001/users/ -->create post request to add user
 localhost:3001/users/remove/:id --> you will need to remove a user by id. This should be get request.

 Now you have to do this in express generator. Note: The users route is already created. so now make all these urls work in express generator app. 
 Make sure you move all functions in userscontroller.js file

3) Below is assignment u did in express before.  
create a products api. 
each product has a format like {name:"Tshirt",price:1233,description:"amazing tshirt",itemcount:12}

now create urls as 
 localhost:3001/products --> show all products in json
 localhost:3001/products/:id --> to show each product
 localhost:3001/products/ -->create post request to add product
 localhost:3001/products/remove/:id --> you will need to remove a product by id. This should be get request.

 Now you have to do this in express generator. Note: The products route is already created. so now make all these urls work in express generator app. 
 Make sure you move all functions in productscontroller.js file

4) you have created product api, users api and todo api. but one this is pending. that is modifying the item. 
Now you will create a form called modifytodo. in this form you will create a form where you can select the id to modify(make it as a select box). then show other fields. then you can enter the new item details.id you can get from select box. now post this data to the backend using a post request and modify the details as per the id entered. 
You have to do this feature for products, todo and users.
